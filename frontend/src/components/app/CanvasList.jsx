    // My idea is that the link would have a specific url using the slug;

    // the Canvas component. This is why I think Route might be necessary. 
    // However, they could also simply all route to the  same {component},
    // so that the URL would simply be component. This does violate the ethos of
    // having the URL that the user seeing not match up completely with the a
    // path into directories.

    // This other way might also be able to do without my getCanvasURLID()
    // although it seems like the best option for its job right now
